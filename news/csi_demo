**Added:** None

**Changed:**

* ``replay.rebuild_node`` creates ``Placeholder`` streams so that we can build 
  the pipeline properly.
* If no ``stream_name`` is provided for ``SimpleFromEventStream`` then a name 
  is produced from the ``data_address``.
* ``translation.FromEventStream`` now captures environment information via an 
  iterable of funciton calls, it defaults to capturing the conda environment
* ``translation.ToEventModel`` issues a ``RuntimeError`` if the pipeline 
  contains a lambda function, as they are not capturable.

**Deprecated:** None

**Removed:**

* ``replay.replay`` ``export`` kwarg. We no longer auto add data to a databroker 

**Fixed:** None

**Security:** None
